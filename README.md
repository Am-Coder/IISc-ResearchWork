# HAR using IMU Sensors
This repository contains the work I did at IISc, Bangalore during my summer research internship there in 2019. HAR stands for Human Activity Recognition and the task was to devise an ML approach to predict human motions based on the readings of IMU sensor (it gives acceleromete and gyroscope readings). 

To know in detail, here is the link to the final report I made : https://github.com/Am-Coder/IISc-ResearchWork/blob/master/HAR-Paper.pdf
